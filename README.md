# Weather App – COMP3123 Lab Test 2

This project is a simple React weather application that lets users search for any city and get real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind and pressure.

The goal of the assignment was to practice:
- React basics (state, props, components, events)
- Using Axios to make API requests
- Handling user input and search
- Displaying API data in a UI
- Hosting the project online
- Using Postman
